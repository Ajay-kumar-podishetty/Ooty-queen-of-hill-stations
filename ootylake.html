<h1>A brief note on ooty lake:</h1>
<p>Ooty lake is located in Ooty in the Nilgiris district, Tamil Nadu, India. It covers an area of 65 acres.The Boat house situated by the lake, which offers boating facilities to tourists, is a major tourist attraction in Ooty.Ooty lake is an artificial lake constructed by John Sullivan, in 1824. The water flowing down mountain streams in the Ooty valley was dammed to form the lake. The lake became empty on three occasions when it breached its bund. The lake was originally intended to be used for fishing with ferries being used to travel across the lake. It gradually shrunk from its original size giving place to the current bus stand race course, and the lake park. The Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation on behalf of the Tourism Department took the possession of the lake in 1973, for providing boating facilities as a tourist attraction.The lake is surrounded by groves of Eucalyptus trees with a railway line running along one shore.During the summer season in May, boat races and boat pageantry are organised for two days</p>
