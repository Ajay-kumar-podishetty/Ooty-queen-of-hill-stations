Started in the year 1899, even more than a century later, it has continued to charms its visitors with equal zest winding its way through the best of nature. Weaving amidst the forests, dark snaking tunnels, sharp bends, up and down the slope, amid the mist and fog, birds and trees dancing along, whistling, passing through the stunning gorge, sunlight dancing above and dream-like drizzling, the Toy Train is an experience of a lifetime.Apart from offering a beautiful journey, the uniqueness of the trip lies in the fact that the rail system is the steepest in Asia and worth a visit.</p>
