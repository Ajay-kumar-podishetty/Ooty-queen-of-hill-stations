<h1>A brief note on Doddabetta:</h1>
<p id="`inf">The Doddabetta Peak stands at an altitude of 2,623 meters. It is the highest point in the district, making it possibly the best vantage point around Ooty.The Doddabetta Peak is said to be one of the highest peak in south India & famous tourist spot in India. It is merely 10kms from Ooty so you can simply grab your camera and head straight to the peak, and click amazing pictures of the valley below. On a clear day, which is honestly not that often, one can see far off areas, even the plains of Coimbatore and the flat highlands of Mysore.
Ooty is undisputedly one of the best hill stations of South India and anyone who visits it is so completely charmed by its beauty that he cherishes the desire to visit it over and over again.There is a "Telescope house" that is run by the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation in the Doddabetta Peak to enable the tourist to get a better view.Trekking to the top peak as it is not very challenging, and at the same time provides views that are worth every step you take through the jungles.</p>
